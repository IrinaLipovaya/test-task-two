# Test task two
*It was implemented in Jan, 2017. I've made it public here just in case if other front-end developers can find some relevant information for similar tasks. For example, how to structure their test tasks or what kind of tools can be useful while coding.*

First I designed the pages I was required to build.

![Signup page](./mockups/signup-page.png)

![Login page](./mockups/login-page.png)

![Forgot password page](./mockups/forgot-password-page.png)

## Implementation 
1. I wanted to implement it as a Single Page app and chose AngularJS to help me with that
2. To run the project, we need to run a server locally. 
    * `npm install http-server -g`
    * `http-server location-to-the-project-folder`
3. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` and vual√°, you see the login page :)

*Btw, the design implementation is fully responsive. Sometimes you don't have any instructions/mock-ups how to make a design look good for tablet/mobile screen sizes. Just rely on your logic and UX knowledge :)*
